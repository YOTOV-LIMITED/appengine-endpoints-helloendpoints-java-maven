Update the value of `application` in `appengine-web.xml` to the app ID you\r\n   have registered in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host\r\n   your instance of this sample.\r\n1. Optional step: These sub steps are not required but will enable the \"Authenticated\r\nGreeting\" functionality.\r\n   1. Update the values in [src/main/java/com/example/helloendpoints/Constants.java](src/main/java/com/example/helloendpoints/Constants.java) to reflect the web client ID you have registered in the\r\n[Credentials on Developers Console for OAuth 2.0 client IDs][6].\r\n    1. Update the value of `google.devrel.samples.helloendpoints.CLIENT_ID` in\r\n[src/main/webapp/js/base.js](src/main/webapp/js/base.js) to reflect the web client ID you have registered in the\r\n[Credentials on Developers Console for OAuth 2.0 client IDs][6].\r\n1. `mvn clean install`\r\n1. Run the application with `mvn appengine:devserver`, and ensure it's running\r\n   by visiting your local server's address (by default [localhost:8080][5].)\r\n1. Get the client library with `mvn appengine:endpoints_get_client_lib` (it will generate a zip file named `helloworld-v1-java.zip` in the root of your project.)\r\n1. Deploy your application to Google App Engine with `mvn appengine:update`\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://developers.google.com/appengine\r\n[2]: http://java.com/en/\r\n[3]: https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/endpoints/\r\n[4]: https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/maven\r\n[5]: https://localhost:8080/\r\n[6]: https://console.developers.google.com/project/_/apiui/credential\r\n",
